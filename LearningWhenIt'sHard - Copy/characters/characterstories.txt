He now seeks redemption, guarding Velari’s borders from unseen threats.

🌿 Thyra – Voice of the Vines
• 	Gift: Plant telepathy; communicates with Velari’s flora.

Gentle but fierce when provoked, she believes Velari’s forests hold ancient wisdom that could change the fate of the planet.

🧙‍♂️ Vorran – Wizard of the Deep Crystal
• 	Gift: Crystalline telepathy; channels energy through crystal resonance.
• 	Backstory: Vorran lives deep within the mines, where the crystals sing to those who listen. He’s one of the few Velarians who can “speak” to the crystals directly, using their vibrations to cast spells, store memories, and manipulate matter. His tower is built into a living geode, and his knowledge of Velari’s history is unmatched. Though reclusive, he emerges when the planet is in peril, wielding ancient magic that even Kaelis respects.

📜 Velarian History
🌠 Origins of Telepathy
• 	The First Resonance: Legend says Velari’s telepathy was awakened when the planet’s twin moons aligned over the Crystal Nexus, a massive geode buried beneath the surface. The crystals emitted a pulse that unlocked latent psychic abilities in the Velarian ancestors.
• 	The Crystal Wars: Centuries ago, rival factions fought over control of the mines. The war ended when the crystals themselves emitted a psychic scream that shattered minds and forced peace. Since then, mining has been regulated by ritual and overseen by the Crystal Conclave.
• 	The Rift Awakening: The Hollow Veil opened mysteriously 200 years ago. Kaelis’s ancestors were the first to explore its chaotic energies, leading to the rise of witchcraft and the formation of the Hollow Veil faction.

🏡 Daily Life on Velari
🧘‍♀️ Morning Rituals
• 	Velarians begin their day with a Resonance Meditation, tuning their minds to the local crystal frequencies. This helps regulate emotions and strengthen telepathic control.
• 	Children attend Mindcraft Academies, where they learn to shield their thoughts, project emotions, and communicate silently.
🛍️ Economy & Trade
• 	Crystalcrafting is central—artisans shape crystals into tools, memory stones, and even psychic amplifiers.
• 	Velari trades with select off-world allies, exporting resonant crystals and telepathic tech, but many factions oppose too much external influence.
🏞️ Environment & Travel
• 	Travel is often done via gliders that ride magnetic currents emitted by crystal veins.
• 	Forest paths are guided by sentient vines that respond to telepathic signals, especially from plant-speakers like Thyra.
🧑‍⚖️ Justice & Conflict Resolution
• 	Disputes are settled in Echo Chambers, where empaths like Nyari replay emotional imprints to uncover truth.
• 	Combat is rare but ritualized—telepathic duels involve projecting illusions and reading intent, not brute force.
