🌍 Velarian Culture
🧠 Telepathy as Identity
• 	Core to Society: Every Velarian is born with telepathic ability, and it’s considered a sacred trait. Children are taught to control and refine their gifts from an early age.
• 	Social Norms: Privacy is nuanced—while thoughts can be sensed, it’s taboo to probe without consent. Emotional telepaths like Nyari are often revered as counselors or truth-seekers.
• 	Art & Expression: Velarian art is often telepathic in nature—crystal sculptures that emit emotional echoes, or music that resonates directly with the mind.
💎 Crystal Reverence
• 	Spiritual Significance: Crystals are more than resources—they’re sentient relics believed to hold ancestral memories. Mining is done with ritual and respect.
• 	Crystalline Temples: Sacred sites built into purple mountains where crystals “sing” to those who listen. Vorran’s tower is one such place.
🌿 Nature & Harmony
• 	Forest Bonds: Velarians live in harmony with the violet forests. Plant telepaths like Thyra are considered guardians of the wild.
• 	Seasonal Festivals: Celebrations tied to planetary alignments and crystal blooms. These events include communal telepathic storytelling, where memories are shared in vivid detail.

🏛️ Velarian Politics
🔮 The Crystal Conclave
• 	Governing Body: A council of seven, each representing a different telepathic discipline (empath, combat, nature, memory, foresight, ritual, resonance).
• 	Selection: Members are chosen through a combination of public consensus and crystal attunement—crystals “resonate” with those they deem worthy.
🧙‍♀️ Factions & Power Centers
• 	The Hollow Veil: Kaelis leads a faction of witches and mystics who believe Velari’s future lies in mastering chaotic energies. They often clash with the Conclave.
• 	The Deep Crystal Order: Vorran’s circle of wizards who study ancient crystal magic. They are secretive but influential, especially in times of planetary crisis.
• 	The Forest Kin: Led informally by Thyra and other nature telepaths, they advocate for ecological balance and oppose over-mining.
⚔️ Tensions & Conflicts
• 	Resource Strain: As demand for crystals grows off-world, debates rage over whether Velari should trade or isolate.
• 	Telepathic Inequality: Some Velarians have stronger gifts than others, leading to social stratification. Empaths and foresight telepaths often hold more sway.
• 	The Shadow Rift: A mysterious tear in reality near the Hollow Veil—some believe it’s a portal, others a curse. Kaelis wants to harness it; the Conclave wants it sealed.
